# 01-fastapi-crud-with-postgres

A minimal FastAPI CRUD project using PostgreSQL.

This project is designed for **learning backend fundamentals**, not for production features.

---

## Purpose

- Learn correct **FastAPI project structure**
- Understand **CRUD end-to-end**
- Clearly separate responsibilities:
    - HTTP
    - Business logic
    - Database access

Async, ORM, and advanced topics are intentionally excluded.

---

## Architecture

Router → HTTP layer (request / response, status codes)
Service → Business logic
Repository → Database access (SQL)
Database → Connection handling
Schemas → Input / output models


Rule of thumb:

- **Router**: deals with HTTP
- **Service**: decides *what is allowed*
- **Repository**: talks to the database only

---

## CRUD Endpoints

- POST /users
- GET /users/{id}
- PUT /users/{id}
- DELETE /users/{id}

---

## Tech Stack

- FastAPI (sync)
- PostgreSQL
- psycopg3
- Pydantic

---

## Notes

- IDs are auto-generated by PostgreSQL and **not guaranteed to be sequential**
- One request = one database transaction
- Errors are handled at the correct layer

---

## Status

✅ Finished  
This project serves as the **foundation** for later projects.
