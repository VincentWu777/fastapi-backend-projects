# fastapi-backend-projects

This repository documents my **learning process and outcomes** in FastAPI backend development.

It progresses from foundational concepts—such as schema design, dependency injection, and async I/O—to complete, production-style backend systems built with **FastAPI** and **async PostgreSQL**.

Each project represents a concrete milestone in this learning journey, focusing on engineering practices rather than isolated tutorials.

## Tech Stack

- FastAPI
- Pydantic v2
- PostgreSQL (async)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Alembic
- pytest
- Docker
